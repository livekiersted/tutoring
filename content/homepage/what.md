**I specialize in three types of students who need more than standard tutoring.**

1. **Gifted kids who need to go deep** The deepest, most interesting mathematical ideas emerge when you slow down and dig in. I help kids who are bored in class and ready to go deeper, uncover the real structure of math, and develop the habits of mind that lead to powerful mathematical thinking. There is a deep well of mathematics to explore in every corner of the field. You're learning about place value? Cool. Let's do that in different base number systems. You can multiply in base 7? Cool. How about base 1.5? What does that even mean? Let's explore together with joy. You don’t need calculus in third grade—you need an environment where you can **think, explore, and follow your curiosity to its furthest edge.** Some of the most fascinating problems in math can be explored using nothing more than arithmetic, and some of them remain unsolved—cracking one could win you a Fields Medal.

2. **Adults who grew up believing they "weren’t math people" and want to break that cycle.** Maybe you’re taking a class, switching careers, or just starting to suspect that the way you learned math wasn’t the only way. If you grew up feeling like math was an arbitrary set of rules, I can show you what was missing—the beauty, the clarity, and the logic that makes it all make sense. I especially love working with parents who want to break the cycle of math trauma and create a different experience for their kids. When you understand math conceptually, you can teach it with confidence, and your kids can thrive where you once struggled.

3. **Students who are realizing that memorizing steps isn’t working.** If you’ve been getting by in math by memorizing formulas and procedures, you’ve probably hit a wall. That wall might be algebra, calculus, or AP physics—but it’s the same problem underneath. **Without understanding, there’s no foundation to build on.** When we work together, we’ll strip away the meaningless memorization and rebuild your understanding from the ground up. You’ll know why things work, not just what to do, and you’ll finally feel like math makes sense.
