I'm Live Kiersted, and I've been helping people understand math and physics for 20 years. I graduated **magna cum laude** from Brown University with a degree in **physics**, and I built a career around making complex ideas **clear, approachable, and deeply satisfying** to learn.

My understanding of **trauma and learning** transformed my approach to math and physics education. As a teacher, I **designed and led a trauma-informed, heterogeneously grouped algebra class** where there was no limit to how deep each student could go. I understand that **math trauma is real,** and educators neglect it at our peril. Nervous system regulation is a **prerequisite** for learning—when students feel safe, supported, and confident, they can unlock their full potential.

I specialize in working with three types of learners:

- **Gifted students** who need a deeper mathematical well to draw from, rather than just being rushed ahead to more advanced coursework.
- **Adults overcoming math trauma**, especially parents who want to support their children in a way they were never supported themselves.
- **Frustrated students** who are hitting the limits of meaningless memorization and are ready to build true understanding.

My approach is **clear, direct, and deeply supportive**. I will meet you where you are and guide you toward mastery with **zero wasted effort**—just deep, meaningful learning that finally makes sense.
